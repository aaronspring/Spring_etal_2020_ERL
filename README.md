# Spring et al., 2020, ERL

The paper is published in Environmental Research Letters: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abc443

## Aim

This repo is setup for scientists interested to reproduce our `Spring et al., 2020` paper. It contains scripts to reproduce the analysis and create the shown figures. It is inspired by `Irving (2015)` to enhance reproducibility in geosciences.

## Computation

The results in this paper were obtained using a number of different software packages. The command line tool known as Climate Data Operators (CDO) was used to aggregate output and perform routine calculations on those files (e.g., the calculation of temporal and spatial means). For more complex analysis and visualization, a Python distribution called Anaconda was used. A Python library called `xarray` was used for reading/writing netCDF files and data analysis. `matplotlib` (the default Python plotting library) was used to generate the figures.
